# Samsung Data Upload Scripts

Contains scripts for pushing feature data to the MongoDB database. I've yet to implement the convenient feature of command line arguments to the scripts but I will if they become frequently used by others.

Each script requires you specify the path to the directory of data downloaded from the Samsung Health app, otherwise they shouldn't require any modifictions to run properly.
