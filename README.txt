Takes data from the fitbit API and sends directly to MongoDB Atlas in JSON format.

Please note that you need to add your specific CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET as well as username and password to the authentication string.

You can edit the data types/features as needed. I just added 5 as an example.
